# WHAT THIS PROJECT HAVE

This project Has some test code, witch does parsers using DOM, SAX and JaxB.
This Project also have same example codes to read and to write file using InputStream from java API 
and it has same serialization and unserialization as well. 


# DOM - Document Object Model - Tree Based

With it you can read and write xml, but its not so straight when you need to populate your POJOS.


# SAX - Simple API for XML - Event Base

With this usually you read files because it is much more efficient in consume memory terms.


# JaxB - Its a good option when you want populate your POJOS or create XML from your POJOS
